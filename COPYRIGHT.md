## Credits

Most of the dielectric field calculations are based upon [Bo Sernelius' lecture on electrodynamics](http://www.ifm.liu.se/courses/TFYY67/), especially lecture 13.

The EFI calculation is an (incomplete) implementation of the formulas given by Arnon/Baumeister, 1980.

Thermal noise calculations where taken from [Sean Leavey's implementation](https://github.com/SeanDS/dielectric-thermal-noise), he in turn credits the following sources:

- http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/19/5/305
- http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=851432 (for the correction to perpendicular component of the loss angle from Harry et al. 2002)
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/24/2/008
- GWINC (for the simplified version of the parallel component of Poisson's ratio)
- Personal discussion with colleagues
